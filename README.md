This is a temporary repo for my modification of the [3D Kyria case](https://github.com/splitkb/kyria/tree/master/3D%20Printed%20Case) designed by Stephen Onnen. I added external legs to support tenting, which should be compatible with both the [Ergodox tenting legs](https://ergodox-ez.com/products/tilt-tent-kit) as well as the 3D printable legs for [this Iris case](https://github.com/wizarddata/Iris-Case/tree/master/High%20Profile) designed by [wizarddata](https://github.com/wizarddata).
