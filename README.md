The m3 nut boxes for the legs are slightly smaller in V2 so that the legs properly screw on. Also, for V2 it prints best with no supports. Obviously you need supports for the overhangs at the very top of the case.

Here's a link to the modified tent leg so that they can be printed flat without supports: https://a360.co/3385Fum
